      This is an experiment looking to see if we can do any better at making
      URLs that work even when the destination is inaccessible. In particular,
      some misuse of the <code>data</code> URL scheme provides some interesting
      possibilities for fmaking URLs that have more intelligence than just a
      resource locator. A longer description is at the link below, but for
      reference, most browsers can access this page as:
